1.Technology- As we know that technology increase day by day. So I think we

need to more focus on technology risk. The main reason is that every thing is

nowadays depend upon technology. So if I am talking about my venture,

technology play a very important role because every thing is available online. That

main threat is in my venture that the application might be crash. moreover, it

could be hacked by someone. So these technology risk can create the problem in

my venture.



2.Reputational risk- for any kind of business reputation is much important. One

bad service can ruin our company reputation. I think that the reputational risk is

very big risk in a venture because it is very difficult to gain reputation. If anybody

post a negative information on social media about my venture, then it will create

reputational risk.

3.Financial- As we know to make online application we need to have a good team.

for all these things there is need of huge money. Moreover, the financial risk

caused by the movement of stock prices, funding risk, interest rate risk.

moreover, financial risk also changes the rate of tax.



4.Team â€“ well, team plays a vital role in every business. So if our team member

gets a good opportunity from other organisation than he/she can share the main

information with the other organisation than this will become the main threat in

my business.



5.Government- To start new business we have to follow some rules of

government. To get an accessible parking permit is the main threat. sometime

government changes the laws regarding the parking so it will effect our business.
